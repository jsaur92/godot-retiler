description="TileSet and Texture2D go in, TileMapLayer comes out. A dock plugin that allows you to generate a populated TileMapLayer node by inputting a TileSet and a texture (generally exported from your pixel art editor or some other outside source) made of tiles from that TileSet. Useful for when you're reusing assets from a different game or engine and you have a flat image of a tilemap, but you want the power to manipulate it as a TileMapLayer without having to recreate it from the ground up."
